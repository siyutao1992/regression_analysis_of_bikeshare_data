# Regression Analysis of Bikesharing Data

* **Summary**: This is a course project for STAT 350-0 at Northwestern University. I collaborated with Yu-Chin Chan to conduct regression analysis of bikesharing data from Capital Bikeshare company in Washington DC. We applied to the dataset regression analysis techniques learned in and out of class.

* **Description of (cleaned) data**:

  * Total number of variables = 12
  * Total number of categorical variables = 7
  * Total number of continuous variables = 5
  * Total number of observations = 731

* **Regression models and analysis methods used**:

  * Linear regression model
  * Stepwise and best subset model selection
  * Fine model selection via cross-validation
  * Diagnostics of influential observations and error normality
  * Polynomial regression model
  * Generalized boosting model

* **Programming language**: R

* **File description**:

    The file "main.R" contains all the analysis code for this project.
